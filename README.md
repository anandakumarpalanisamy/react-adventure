## Description

We all know the struggle about _Frontend patterns_, specially when it comes to big projects, it become a mess over the time.

For this reason we created the `React Adventure` in order to provide a **workable, maintainable and scalable environment overtime**, wrapped with the best *technological stack* and *patterns* available in the market.

## React Adventure Pattern

### Motivation

We all have or will work with outdated/monolith project, hard to code, maintain and to implement new stacks of technology.

Usually in those projects, we face **huge JavaScripts files**, sometimes with **over than 1MB**! This is a **huge issue**, especially for mobile uses.

According to [Sam Saccone from Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWLzUnESylc), this file would take to be read by the browser on Samsung Galaxy S7 ~850 ms and Nexus 5 in **~1700 ms**!

Besides that, we would have *scalability penalty* for such environment, costing more server power ~~and money!~~ to deliver the same expected behavior.

In other words, this would be an unsustainable environment we would be facing, with our resources being drained each time more, and by resources, I mean both **financial** and **human**.

Because of such actual possibility, we build **React Adventure**.

> _The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy._
> ###### _Martin Luther King Jr._

<br />

### Goal

As Engineers, we're constantly looking for new ways to *improve* and *add new features* to our code **without have to refactor** it.

By this reason, we came up with this approach, which give us the ability to:

Paraphrasing Steve Krug:
> _"Making every component, function or screen self-evident is like having good lighting in a store: **it just makes everything seem better**."_

So we defined as a goal:

* Make every `component, function or screen self-evident`.
* To create a `readable` code.
* To `safely delete` legacy/unused code without effort or break the application.
* To `easily create or update` different part of the application, in the shortest possible time.
* Be able to `implement new techs with minimum refactory effort`.

### Structure Pattern

The bellow structure is the result of a several patterns studies and implementations over the time.

Note that in the `components` folder, there's a folder called `v1`, which is to represent the current components versions.

## Asynchronous Component Preview

One of the `React Adventure` _features_ is the component loading by demand (asynchronous loading)., which give us the power of really small JavaScript files, splitted into chunks.

Take a peek on the _network_ tab and see the files being loaded by demand.
